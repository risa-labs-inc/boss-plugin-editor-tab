# Auto-bump the privately-bundled BossEditor version in build.gradle.kts.
#
# Run from the repo root. Reads the currently bundled `bosseditor-compose-desktop`
# version, resolves the latest release that is actually live on Maven Central, and
# — if a newer one exists — rewrites the dependency line and the plugin version,
# then writes a PR body to pr-body.md. The calling workflow does the git/PR/merge.
#
# The counterpart to terminal-tab's bump-bossterm.sh. BossEditor is bundled into
# this plugin's JAR rather than provided by the host, so picking up a BossEditor
# release means re-releasing this plugin and nothing else.
#
# Intentionally deterministic (no AI). Portable sed/awk so it also runs on macOS
# for local testing.
#
# Inputs (env):
#   TARGET_VERSION  optional — force a specific bosseditor version (manual/test runs)
#   GITHUB_OUTPUT   optional — GitHub Actions step-output file (falls back to stdout)
#
# Outputs (to $GITHUB_OUTPUT):
#   changed=true|false, new_be=<ver>, new_plugin=<ver>
