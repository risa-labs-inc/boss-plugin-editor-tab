/**
 * One live editor buffer, shared by every tab/split viewport on the same
 * path (decision D3, boss-plugin-api 1.0.87).
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - ONE BUFFER PER PATH: two tabs on the same file are two viewports over
 *   this one [EditorState], never copies.
 * - MONOTONIC VERSION: [version] is the BossEditor document version, bumped
 *   on every document change; applyEdit-style writes fail stale when it has
 *   moved on.
 * - Changes are observable: [observe] emits one [BufferChange] (version only,
 *   per the api contract) per document change and completes when the last
 *   viewport releases the buffer.
