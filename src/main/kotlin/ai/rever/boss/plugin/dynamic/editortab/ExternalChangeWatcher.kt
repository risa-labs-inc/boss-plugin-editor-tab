/**
 * Keeps open buffers honest about the files behind them.

 * A file edited outside BOSS - a `git checkout`, a rebase, a formatter, another
 * editor - used to leave the tab showing content that no longer existed, which
 * meant the user could be reading, or typing into, a version of the file that
 * was gone. `EditorTabComponent` had `hasExternalChanges()` and
 * `reloadFileFromDisk()` for exactly this and nothing ever called them.
 *
 * Polling rather than a `WatchService`: it is what the codebase plugin's
 * FileWatcherService already does here, it needs no per-directory registration
 * or macOS-specific tuning, and the set being watched is tiny - only paths that
 * have an open buffer, which is a handful of files, not a project tree.
 *
 * The decision itself is not here. It lives in [ExternalChangePolicy], pure and
 * unit tested, because "reload or ask" is a small state machine whose failure
 * mode is eating unsaved work.
