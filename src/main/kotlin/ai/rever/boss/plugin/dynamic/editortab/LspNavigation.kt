/**
 * Go-to-definition over LSP, for the languages PSI does not cover.
 *
 * The bosseditor library ships a complete LSP stack - transport, client,
 * [LanguageServerManager], [LspNavigationProvider] - and until now nothing
 * constructed any of it. `LanguageServerManager` had no call site at all, so no
 * server was ever spawned and no `initialize` was ever sent; the only code that
 * touched LSP was the settings screen, which PATH-probes the registered servers
 * and shows them as "installed". That is why the feature looked implemented.
 *
 * Cmd+Click resolution itself went to the internal PSI `NavigationManager`,
 * which returns `Unavailable` for anything that is not `.kt`/`.kts`. This class
 * is the other half: the editor keeps PSI for Kotlin (PSI is the only path that
 * can answer ShowUsages, and `navigationResolver` cannot express it - see
 * [NavigationResolveResult]) and routes every other language here.
 *
 * Servers are started lazily, on the first navigation in a file whose language
 * has a registered server, and are reused across files and panels for the life
 * of the plugin.
